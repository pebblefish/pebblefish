Pebblefish
==========

a social experience for a more social world


What it is
----------

To create a truly social experience, online communication must be personal. Pebblefish balances public communication with more private correspondence. Using friend-to-friend (F2F) networking, Pebblefish allows friends to chat and share in a meaningful and private way.

Pebblefish has two account types. Pebblefish accounts are free accounts used by individual people. Pebblefish users can friend (up to 256) other Pebblefish users. Friendships are mutual. Goldfish accounts are paid accounts used by corporate / professional entities and other organizations. Pebblefish users can follow Goldfish accounts to receive updates and news. Goldfish accounts may have unlimited followers.


How it works
------------
Pebblefish is being designed as a stand-alone application; however, browser integration is being considered.

To develop Pebblefish, three design goals must be reached. First, a method of creating a F2F network must be implemented. The network should connect only friends (using friends of friends only when necessary) and must provide an substantial amount of security to prevent hacks. The network will be responsible for sending updates and messages among friends and followers. Additionally, the network should be able to store users’ profile information so users can log on with multiple devices. Second, the local application must obtain updates and merge them with the local copy of Pebblefish history, including messages, updates, and the user’s profile information. Third, a UI must be designed using a platform-appropriate graphics library. The UI will resemble that of www.pebblefish.org. The UI must present the data held in the local copy of Pebblefish history, as well as present a welcome screen and a settings menu.
